# Mathematik-fuer-die-Informatik-B-SS23-CAU-Kiel

## Why?
This repository exists to help us organise our homework in Mathe B while also synchronising our latex code.
We hope our solutions will be useful for future students at this shithole of an university.

## How?
Every assigment and our solutions are in the Folders named "A*" where * is a placeholder for the number of the given homework.
This latex code could be compiled in any enviroment, but the main contributor prefers Latexmk as it was reccommended by the prof.
Precompiled pdfs will be also placed in the same directories as the assigments and our solutions to them, so don't worry if you don't like to compile the latex yourself.
